            <h2>Who is our client & what is Project Serenate:</h2>
            <p>
                Our client is the McMaster marching band (MMB). The goal of this project is to create a website to serve
                as a graphical user
                interface to commission the McMaster marching band to serenate your loved one for this upcoming
                valentines day. Commissions
                are completely free.
            </p>

                <h2>Elements of our initial report</h2>
                <li><strong>Target Users:</strong> University students on mobile devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Static Information:</strong> Names of the band, when and where they practice, ability to
                    contact/commission the band, contact for any further help.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Elements:</strong> The app should be more vertical, since we anticipate most users
                    being mobile.</li>
                <li><strong>Data:</strong> Our performances to show what the band is capable of.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Interactive Elements</strong> A statistic showing satisfied people (similar to a like
                    button).</li>
